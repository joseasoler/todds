A CPU-based DDS encoder optimized for fast batch conversions with high encoding quality.

### Performance

todds can encode multiple files at once at high speeds, without compromising on encoding quality. It also provides great performance when processing single files, and may be faster than other implementations depending on your hardware.

You can find detailed reports and benchmark results here: https://github.com/joseasoler/todds/wiki/Performance

### Supported encoding formats

BC7 support is implemented using the [bc7e.ispc](https://github.com/richgel999/bc7enc_rdo) library. BC1 support has been implemented with the [rgbcx](https://github.com/richgel999/bc7enc_rdo) library.

As seen in the [Texture Compression in 2020](https://aras-p.info/blog/2020/12/08/Texture-Compression-in-2020/) blog post, these libraries provide great encoding quality and performance.

todds also supports a mixed mode called BC1_ALPHA_BC7. When this mode is enabled, PNG files with alpha values will be converted to BC7 while files without alpha will be converted to BC1.

## Building

Compiling todds requires a recent C++ compiler version, the [IntelÂ® Implicit SPMD Program Compiler](https://github.com/ispc/ispc) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

### CMake options
```
TODDS_CLANG_TIDY -> Analyze the project with clang-tidy. Off by default.
TODDS_CPP_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS -> Treat warnings as errors. On by default
TODDS_UNIT_TESTS -> Build todds unit tests. Off by default.
```
