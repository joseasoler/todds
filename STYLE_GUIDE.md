# Style guide

todds code formatting is mostly handled by the rules set in the .clang-format and .clang-tidy files. Besides the rules described in those files, there are some additional points to keep in mind: 

* Private member variables must be prefixed by a single underscore (_).

* Header files must use the hpp extension.

* The project uses a single tab for indentation instead of spaces (see https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/).
